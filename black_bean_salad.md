# Black Bean Salad

from [the kitchn.com](https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-spicy-salmon-black-bean-salad-244647)

I'm omitting the smoked salmon from that recipe because this works well as a side for a bunch of different proteins, or none at all.

## ingredients

- 1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 medium avocado, diced
- 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice 
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
- Pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
- some cotija or queso fresco (optional)
- 1 cob of corn (optional)

## procedure

- make dressing with the lime juice, olive oil, cumin, cayenne, and salt
- combine the beans, sliced avocado, and sliced cherry tomatos with the dressing

### even fancier
- throw some crumbled cotija or queso fresco on there
- roast corn with butter & some spices, either on or off cob, add kernels to the salad.
