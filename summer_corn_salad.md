# summer corn salad 

from [Smitten Kitchen:](https://smittenkitchen.com/2024/07/summer-steak-with-corn-and-tomatoes/)


- 2 ears fresh corn
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced (white and green)
- 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered
- 1 jalapeño, seeds removed, finely chopped
- 1 cup finely-chopped fresh herbs such as parsley, mint, basil, chives, or a mix thereof

**Make corn and tomato salad:** Cook the corn your favorite way; I use the grill. Heat your grill to a high heat. Shuck the cobs, removing any stringy bits, and lightly oil the cobs. Place directly on the grill and cook until charred spots form, rotating the cobs as needed. This can take about 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how robust your grill is. Set the cobs aside to cool slightly while you make the dressing.

Pour olive oil, cider vinegar, kosher salt, many grinds of black pepper, and minced garlic in a medium-large bowl and whisk to combine. When corn is cool enough to handle (with a towel, if needed), cut the kernels from the cob and add to the dressing in the bowl. Scatter tomatoes, jalapeño, scallions, and herbs on top of the corn in layers, but I don’t bother mixing it at this point. I like the corn to marinate and gently pickle in the dressing while I cook the steak. Do ahead: Corn salad can be made 1 hour in advance. If you’d like to make it even earlier, I’d leave the herbs off until right before serving so they don’t discolor.
