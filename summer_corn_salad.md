### summer corn salad ###

from [Smitten Kitchen:](https://smittenkitchen.com/2024/07/summer-steak-with-corn-and-tomatoes/)


- 2 ears fresh corn
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced (white and green)
- 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered
- 1 jalapeño, seeds removed, finely chopped
- 1 cup finely-chopped fresh herbs such as parsley, mint, basil, chives, or a mix thereof

**Make corn and tomato salad:** Cut the corn off the cobs, then roast it on a very hot skillet until they are looking slighly brown/charred and smelling good. I don't use oil for this in a cast iron skillet, but you could.

Whisk together the olive oil, cider vinegar, kosher salt, fresh black pepper, and minced garlic.
Throw the roasted kernels into the dressing.

Scatter tomatoes, jalapeño, scallions, and herbs on top of the corn in layers, and let the corn marinate a bit. 

Do ahead: Corn salad can be made 1 hour in advance.
