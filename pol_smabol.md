- 340 G grated, coconut, +/- (this is one package of frozen which they sell at [Viks](https://vikschaat.com/))
- 6 whole dried red chillies
- 2 TB minced red onion, shallot, button onions
- 1 tbsp Maldive fish
- 1 tsp salt
- a lime
- mustard seeds
- 6 curry leaves


Put salt, chilis and maldives fish chips into blender, and get them as fine as you can. Then:

Throw in the whole chillies (or chilli flakes and chili powder) and salt into a mortar and pestle and grind till it turns into a fine paste (there should be no visible chilli seeds).

Next, add the Maldive fish and mix in with the paste.

Mortar this all until it's as finely integrated as you can make it--it's a lot of work.

Add _half_ the onions. Using the pestle crush the onions and combine with the chilli paste. 

Throw all of that into the coconut, and mix it, _while squeezing_, with your hand. Squeezing distributes the flavor.

Heat around 1 tbsp of oil in a frying pan until very hot. 

Throw in 1 tsp of mustard seeds. 

When they start to pop and splutter, add the remaining onion/shallot and 5-6 curry leaves. 

Sauté until onions turn golden brown. Add the coconut mixture and give it a good mix. 

Sauté the sambol until the coconut turns slightly dry (around 2-3 minutes). 

Deglaze the pan with lime juice, and mix it to incorporate. At least one whole lime, and scrape the pan.

Allow to cool completely before jarring for refrigerator.
