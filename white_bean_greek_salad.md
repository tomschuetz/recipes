All of this is pretty loosey-goosey, to taste

## ingredients

- 1 can cannellini or just white beans
- ten or so kalamata olives, pitted
- half a red onion, sliced into thinnish quarter-moons (doesn't need to be paper thin, chunky is fine)
- as much persian/english cuke as you want, sliced into thinnish quarter-moons
- feta cheese? (optional)

## procedure

_de-fang the onions:_

submerge them in a bowl of cold or ice water. Let them sit for at least ten minutes, stirring once or twice

_dressing (taste as you go):_

2 parts fresh lemon juice
3 parts olive oil
bit of salt
bit of black pepper

_assemble:_

dress the beans & cukes in the dressing, add kalamatas

_even fancier:_

throw some feta on there
