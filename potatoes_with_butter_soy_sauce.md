## ingredients
- About 500g / 1 lb tiny organic new potatoes, washed and unpeeled
- Salt
- 2 Tbs. butter (You can use olive oil instead. But, you know, sometimes it just has to be butter.)
- 1 Tbs. soy sauce
- Coarsely ground black pepper or Sansho （山椒）

## procedure


- Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F.

- Put the potatoes in a pan with water to cover; add salt (the water should taste almost as salty as sea water). Bring to a boil and cook for about 5 minutes. (Do this while the oven is heating up.)

- Drain the potatoes. Melt the butter in the same pan and add the soy sauce. Mix the potatoes and butter-soy sauce well, and put onto a baking sheet.

- Roast for 25 to 30 minutes unti the potatoes are browned and cooked through. Serve warm or at room temperature sprinkled with a little sansho/sanshou pepper (available at Japanese grocery stores) or black pepper.
