## For the Salad

    1.5 pounds baby potatoes, halved if large
    3 tablespoons olive oil
    Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
    1 bunch thick asparagus (about 1 pound), ends trimmed, stalks cut crosswise in thirds
    1 large leek, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise then cut into ½-inch-thick half-moons
    1 teaspoon sweet paprika
    4 hard-boiled eggs (optional), quartered

## For the Shallot Dressing

    .33 cup olive oil
    2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
    1 small shallot, minced (about 2 tablespoons)
    1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
    1 teaspoon honey
    2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves (from about ⅓ bunch)


**Step 1

Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Place the potatoes on a large sheet pan, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Toss to coat, then spread in an even layer and roast for 15 minutes.

**Step 2

In a medium bowl, toss asparagus and leek slices with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and the paprika. Take the potatoes out of the oven and give them a stir. Spread the vegetables evenly on top of the potatoes. Cook until the vegetables are tender and browned in spots, 10 to 15 minutes.

**Step 3

While the vegetables are roasting, make the dressing: Combine the olive oil, vinegar, shallot, mustard, honey and mint in a bowl, then whisk to combine.

**Step 4

When the vegetables are done, spoon the dressing over everything and let sit for about 5 minutes. Serve with hard-boiled eggs, if desired, and sprinkle with mint.
